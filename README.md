The MsBuild-CodeExecution repository demonstrates how arbitrary code execution can be achieved using msbuild.exe, C#, and XML. It is a learning resource for understanding how MSBuild tasks can be manipulated for executing code in an unintended manner, highlighting potential security risks.

Features:

   - Explores MSBuildâ€™s use of XML for task execution.
   - Demonstrates a method for code execution via MSBuild.
